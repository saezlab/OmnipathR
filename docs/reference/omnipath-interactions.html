<dd><p>Character or integer: name or NCBI Taxonomy ID of the
organism. OmniPath is built of human data, and the web service provides
orthology translated interactions and enzyme-substrate relationships for
mouse and rat. For other organisms and query types, orthology
translation will be called automatically on the downloaded human data
before returning the result.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>resources</code></dt>
<dd><p>Character vector: name of one or more resources. Restrict
the data to these resources. For a complete list of available resources,
call the `&lt;query_type&gt;_resources` functions for the query type of
interst.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>datasets</code></dt>
<dd><p>Character vector: name of one or more datasets. In the
interactions query type a number of datasets are available. The default
is caled "omnipath", and corresponds to the curated causal signaling
network published in the 2016 OmniPath paper.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>genesymbols</code></dt>
<dd><p>Character or logical: TRUE or FALS or "yes" or "no".
Include the `genesymbols` column in the results. OmniPath uses UniProt
IDs as the primary identifiers, gene symbols are optional.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>default_fields</code></dt>
<dd><p>Logical: if TRUE, the default fields will be included.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>silent</code></dt>
<dd><p>Logical: if TRUE, no messages will be printed. By default a
summary message is printed upon successful download.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>logicals</code></dt>
<dd><p>Character vector: fields to be cast to logical.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>format</code></dt>
<dd><p>Character: if "json", JSON will be retrieved and processed
into a nested list; any other value will return data frame.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>download_args</code></dt>
<dd><p>List: parameters to pass to the download function,
which is `readr::read_tsv` by default, and `jsonlite::safe_load`.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>references_by_resource</code></dt>
<dd><p>Logical: if TRUE,, in the `references`
column the PubMed IDs will be prefixed with the names of the resources
they are coming from. If FALSE, the `references` column will be a list
of unique PubMed IDs.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>add_counts</code></dt>
<dd><p>Logical: if TRUE, the number of references and number of
resources for each record will be added to the result.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>license</code></dt>
<dd><p>Character: license restrictions. By default, data from
resources allowing "academic" use is returned by OmniPath. If you use
the data for work in a company, you can provide "commercial" or
"for-profit", which will restrict the data to those records which are
supported by resources that allow for-profit use.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>password</code></dt>
<dd><p>Character: password for the OmniPath web service. You can
provide a special password here which enables the use of `license =
"ignore"` option, completely bypassing the license filter.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>json_param</code></dt>
<dd><p>List: parameters to pass to the `jsonlite::fromJSON` when
processing JSON columns embedded in the downloaded data. Such columns
are "extra_attrs" and "evidences". These are optional columns which
provide a lot of extra details about interactions.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>strict_evidences</code></dt>
<dd><p>Logical: reconstruct the "sources" and "references"
columns of interaction data frames based on the "evidences" column,
strictly filtering them to the queried datasets and resources. Without
this, the "sources" and "references" fields for each record might
contain information for datasets and resources other than the queried
ones, because the downloaded records are a result of a simple filtering
of an already integrated data frame.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>genesymbol_resource</code></dt>
<dd><p>Character: "uniprot" (default) or "ensembl". The
OmniPath web service uses the primary gene symbols as provided by
UniProt. By passing "ensembl" here, the UniProt gene symbols will be
replaced by the ones used in Ensembl. This translation results in a loss
of a few records, and multiplication of another few records due to
ambiguous translation.</p></dd>

    <dt><code>cache</code></dt>
<dd><p>Logical: use caching, load data from and save to the. The cache
directory by default belongs to the user, located in the user's default
cache directory, and named "OmnipathR". Find out about it by
<code>getOption("omnipathr.cachedir")</code>. Can be changed by

    <p><strong>Post-translational (protein-protein, PPI) interactions</strong></p>
<ul><li><p><code>omnipath</code>: the OmniPath data as defined in the 2016 paper,
an arbitrary optimum between coverage and quality. This dataset
contains almost entirely causal (stimulatory or inhibitory; i.e.
activity flow , according to the SBGN standard), physical
interactions between pairs of proteins, curated by experts
from the literature.</p></li>
<li><p><code>pathwayextra</code>: activity flow interactions without literature
references.</p></li>
<li><p><code>kinaseextra</code>: enzyme-substrate interactions without
literature references.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ligrecextra</code>: ligand-receptor interactions without
literature references.</p></li>
<li><p><code>post_translational</code>: all post-translational
(protein-protein, PPI) interactions; this is the combination of the
<em>omnipath</em>, <em>pathwayextra</em>, <em>kinaseextra</em> and <em>ligrecextra</em>
datasets.</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>TF-target (gene regulatory, GRN) interactions</strong></p>
<ul><li><p><code>collectri</code>: transcription factor (TF)-target
interactions from CollecTRI.</p></li>
<li><p><code>dorothea</code>: transcription factor (TF)-target
interactions from DoRothEA</p></li>
<li><p><code>tf_target</code>: transcription factor
(TF)-target interactions from other resources</p></li>
<li><p><code>transcriptional</code>: all transcription factor
(TF)-target interactions; this is the combination of the
<em>collectri</em>, <em>dorothea</em> and <em>tf_target</em> datasets.</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>Post-transcriptional (miRNA-target) and other RNA related interactions</strong></p>
<p>In these datasets we intend to collect the literature curated resources,
hence we don't include some of the most well known large databases if those
are based on predictions or high-throughput assays.</p>
<ul><li><p><code>mirna_target</code>: miRNA-mRNA interactions</p></li>
<li><p><code>tf_mirna</code>: TF-miRNA interactions</p></li>
<li><p><code>lncrna_mrna</code>: lncRNA-mRNA interactions</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>Other interaction access functions</strong></p>
<ul><li><p><code>small_molecule</code>: interactions between small molecules and
proteins. Currently this is a small, experimental dataset that
includes drug-target, ligand-receptor, enzyme-metabolite and other
interactions. In the future this will be largely expanded and
divided into multiple datasets.</p></li>
<li><p><code>all_interactions</code>: all the interaction datasets combined.</p></li>
