Description: A client for the OmniPath web service
    (https://www.omnipathdb.org) and many other resources.
    It also includes functions to transform and pretty print
    some of the downloaded data, functions to access a number
    of other resources such as BioPlex, ConsensusPathDB, EVEX,
    Gene Ontology, Guide to Pharmacology (IUPHAR/BPS), Harmonizome,
    HTRIdb, Human Phenotype Ontology, InWeb InBioMap, KEGG Pathway,
    Pathway Commons, Ramilowski et al. 2015, RegNetwork, ReMap, TF
    census, TRRUST and Vinayagam et al. 2011. Furthermore, OmnipathR
    features a close integration  with the NicheNet method for
    ligand activity prediction from transcriptomics data, and its
    R implementation `nichenetr` (available only on github).
